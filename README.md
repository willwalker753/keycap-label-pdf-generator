# Keycap Label PDF Generator

* This python script generates a PDF with a grid of keycap labels. 
* You can change the fixed height, fixed width, and font size of each cell in the variables at the top of the script.

* These labels are intended for "relegendable" (a.k.a. "double layer") keycaps. 

    * [Here is an example](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Mechanical-Keyboards-Keyboard-Projects/dp/B0F7RB7LS9?gQT=1&th=1)

        <img src="images/double_layer_keycaps.jpg" alt="double layer keycaps" height="300">

* The generated PDF looks like this.
